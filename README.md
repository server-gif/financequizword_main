# FinzoriaFinance — Financial Blog (React + Google Ad Manager)

A responsive financial-education publication built with React 19, React Router 7 and Vite,
with Google Ad Manager (GAM) display placements and an interstitial shown when a reader opens an article.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # production build in dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build
```

Set `VITE_SITE_URL=https://finzoriafinance.com` at build time so canonical and Open Graph URLs are correct
(it is already in `.env`, and `src/config/site.js` falls back to the same domain).

## Google Ad Manager

**Only Google's public GPT sample network (`/6355419/...`) is used.** These are test units and never earn revenue.

To go live, edit `src/config/ads.js` and replace each `adUnitPath` with your own unit
(e.g. `/<network-code>/<site>/top_leaderboard`). No component changes are needed.

How it is wired:

- `services/googleAdManager.js` loads GPT once (singleton promise, load timeout), enables services once,
  uses `disableInitialLoad()` + explicit `refresh()` (the SPA-safe pattern), and keeps a single global
  `slotRenderEnded` listener that dispatches to per-slot callbacks — no listener leaks.
- `hooks/useGoogleAdManager.js` defines a slot after its div mounts and destroys it on unmount.
  It is safe under React StrictMode and when a component unmounts before GPT finishes loading.
  Layout ads receive `refreshKey={pathname}` so every page view requests a fresh creative.
- Every slot reserves space (`minHeight` in config) to avoid layout shift; unfilled slots show a neutral placeholder.

### Article click → interstitial → navigation

1. `useArticleLink` gives each card a real, crawlable `href` and intercepts plain left-clicks
   (Ctrl/⌘/middle-click still open a new tab normally).
2. `InterstitialProvider` opens the overlay and requests the interstitial slot.
3. Navigation with React Router happens **exactly once**, when any of these occurs:
   the reader closes the ad (✕, "Continue to article" or Escape) · the slot is empty · GPT errors or is blocked ·
   the ad has not rendered within `interstitial.loadTimeoutMs` (5 s). If GPT already failed, the overlay is skipped entirely.
4. Back/forward or header navigation while the overlay is open simply dismisses it.

`interstitial.frequencyCapMs` (default `0`, i.e. every click while testing) limits how often it appears.

**Why a publisher-controlled overlay instead of GPT's native web interstitial format?**
GPT's `OutOfPageFormat.INTERSTITIAL` cannot be opened from code: Google decides when to show it,
only on its own triggers and frequency caps, and continues with a full page load rather than
React Router navigation. That cannot satisfy "click → show ad → close → SPA navigate". The overlay
here hosts a normal GAM slot instead. Before production, confirm the format and frequency you choose
comply with your Ad Manager agreement and the Better Ads Standards.

## SEO

Each page renders its own `<title>`, meta description, canonical URL, Open Graph/Twitter tags and,
for articles, `Article` JSON-LD (React 19 hoists these into `<head>`). Each page has one H1, with H2/H3
inside article content. Because this is a client-rendered SPA, consider prerendering (or SSR) for the
best crawler and social-preview coverage, and configure your host to serve `index.html` for all routes.

## Content

Articles in `src/data/blogs.js` are general educational content, not personalised advice.
Example figures are illustrative and currency-neutral.
